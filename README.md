    Once you drop this into your folder and push to GitHub, your repo will look **professional** and recruiter-friendly.  
    After you deploy on **Streamlit Cloud**, just replace the `"your-deployment-link"` with your live app link.  

    Do you want me to also make **real screenshots** of your app right now so you can replace the placeholders?  
    That will make your GitHub page look way more legit.
